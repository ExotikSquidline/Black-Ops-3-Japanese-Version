# Black-Ops-3-Japanese-Version

# How to use

* just Drag and Drop the files in ur bo3 root folder and start the game when u want to have the game back in english just change the 1. line of the localize.txt from japanese to english

# Disclaimer
* When u use the mod be prepared that the game Lags when u load in a menu or load in a map
The Lag only happends once since the game needs to load in all the Japanese characters

* also this is the full japanese versions so some things might be broke
